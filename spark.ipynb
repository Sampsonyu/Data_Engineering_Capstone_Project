    "\n",
    "This is the capstone project for the Udacity Data Engineering Nanodegree program. The idea is to take multiple disparate data sources, clean the data, and process it through an ETL pipeline to produce a usable data set for analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be looking at the immigration data for the U.S. ports (I94 immigration data). The plan is to enrich this data using the other data sources suggested, build an ETL pipeline to process the raw data and create a data warehouse which can be used for analytics. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The project follows the follow steps:\n",
    "* Step 1: Scope the Project and Gather Data\n",
    "* Step 2: Explore and Assess the Data\n",
    "* Step 3: Define the Data Model\n",
    "* Step 4: Run ETL to Model the Data\n",
    "* Step 5: Complete Project Write Up"
